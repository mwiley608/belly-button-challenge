Bootcamp Module 14 Challenge - Interactive Visualizations
This project was created as a homework assignment to build an interactive dashboard to evaluate the dataset of the microbes that colonize human navels. 

The html code for the dashboard is contained in the StarterCode folder in a addition to a copy of the json data pulled by D3 in the script. The main JavaScript file is located in the static folder labeled app.js.

I used https://plotly.com/javascript/ as a reference to build the Bar and Bubble charts

The index.html file was provided to me as a starting point.
